\ This is a vocabulary that can be used to contain implementation words
\ that shouldn't appear in the forth dictionary.  It would nice to have
\ the option to compile such words headerless to save space, but that
\ feature will have to wait till later.  (Besides, headerless words make
\ the decompiler less useful).
